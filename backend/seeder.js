/**
 * Seeder file to populate database
 *  - Make sure that you've set up XAMPP correctly with mySQL, and make sure that the db is set up correctly
 *  - The dependency you should have used for Node/Express is mysql2: https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2
 *  - This file assumes that both the seeder file AND the .json files you're seeding from are in the root directory
 *  - It assumes that you're using the userData.json file provided; if you're using a different dataset, you'll need to ajust accordingly
